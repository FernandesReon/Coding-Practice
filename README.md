# Coding-Practice

Welcome to my **Coding Practice** repository!

This repository is created to document my coding journey as I solve problems from platforms like
**LeetCode** and **HackerRank**. It serves two purposes:
- **Progress Tracking:** To keep track of the problems I've solved.
- **Reference Material:** To provide clean solutions and simple explanations that can help others understand different problem-solving approaches.
